                <p>That's essentially our story in one sentence.
                    Crammed up hostels or cooped up PGs - not much of a choice, is it? That's why we created Stanza Living - a place designed by people who've been in your shoes. Understand you. And are inspired by you.</p>

            <h3>You needed a place like home,
                so we moved back home</h3>
                    <p>It was 2015. Two erstwhile IIM-A hostel roomies, Anindya and Sandeep, met again. Reminiscing about the 'good old hostel days', they realised a lot of that 'good' could've been better. So to give youngsters that 'better', in 2017, they set up a base in New Delhi, and the rest, as we say, is the present.</p>

                <p>A place that feels like 'home' as soon as you enter it. A place where we steal away your chores and replace them with care. A place where you'll have technology in your pocket and your tribe by your side. A place that's all about you. And that is no wishful thinking, but our unwavering PACT with you.</p>

                <p>The cushioning of the bed's mattress to the colour of the walls in the hallway and the availability of charging points at an arm's length - every nook and corner of a Stanza Living residence has been designed to reflect you and your current life stage.</p>
